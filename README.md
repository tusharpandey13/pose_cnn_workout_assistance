# pose_cnn_workout_assistance

This is a workout assistant that can count the reps of workouts in realtime using pose-estimation.  
A convolutional neural network is trained on pose data of a selected exercise in it's various states. Pose data is generated from live webcam feed and classification is performed on it to classify it into one of the several states of an exercise. Based on this classification, reps are counted.  
The user can view the results in a web app.
